# CS250-Software-Development-Lifestyle
This course focused on the full spectrum of software development processes, from initial planning to final deployment. We explored Agile methodologies, with a strong emphasis on Scrum roles, ceremonies, and artifacts. Key topics included requirements gathering, system design, testing strategies, and release planning.

**Interpreting User Needs**
Understanding user needs starts with listening — not just to what users say, but to what they value. In this course, I learned to interpret those needs by breaking them down into actionable goals and translating them into features that solve real problems. Whether it was prioritizing wellness-themed travel options or refining slideshow navigation, I focused on clarity, usability, and purpose.

Creating user stories helped me stay grounded in the user's perspective. Each story framed the user’s role, desired functionality, and benefit, which made it easier to align development with expectations. It also gave me a way to validate progress through acceptance criteria, ensuring that what I built actually delivered value.

**My Development Approach**
I approach development with intention and adaptability. I start by mapping out requirements, visualizing system architecture, and identifying potential challenges early. From there, I iterate — refining code, testing usability, and staying open to feedback.

Agile processes like Scrum ceremonies, backlog refinement, and continuous delivery were central to my workflow. In future projects, I plan to incorporate CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and more structured sprint planning to keep development focused and collaborative.

**Being a Good Team Member**
Being a good team member means showing up with respect, clarity, and a willingness to adapt. In our CS250 group work, I leaned into roles like Product Owner and Scrum Master to foster alignment and remove roadblocks. I communicated clearly, prioritized feedback, and supported my peers through structured events and shared tools.

Good teamwork isn’t just about getting the job done — it’s about creating an environment where everyone can contribute meaningfully. That’s the kind of culture I hope to carry forward into future development work.
